# Web Apps Intro

Web Development is the best job in the world.

1. Your platform of choice has nearly 5 billion daily active users!
2. It's a platform that behaves like a super-intelligent brain:
    1. It can cure diseases
    2. Eliminate poverty
    3. Advance science
    4. And share interesting cat memes

# Internet

The Internet is a network of billions (trillions?) of machines connected together, fist establised in the early 1980s. You can think of it as the hardware underlying all the software built on top of it.

Network IP is used to identify machines on the Internet by assigning them a unique IP address, e.g.

# Packets

Data is sent as a collection of small packets across the data link, and resequenced by the receiving device.

# World Wide Web

It's like some software that sits on top of the hardware (the Internet).

# Http

the Hypertext Transfrer Protocol (Http) allows people to access web applications.

# URL

Http gives resources on the web a uniform resource locator (URL) - some unique address.

# Browser 

Browsers allow us to access the web by rendering content at the URLs.

# Client Server
